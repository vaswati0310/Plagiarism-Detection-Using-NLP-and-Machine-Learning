# Plagiarism-Detection-Using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning
Developed a Python-based plagiarism detector using Word2Vec, DistilBERT, and a hybrid similarity metric to classify text into four plagiarism levels with 90% accuracy. Built an interactive Jupyter interface and optimized performance with CUDA and robust preprocessing.


In this project, I created a plagiarism detector system using Python to combine the old NLP methods with the new transformer-based embeddings. I also trained both Word2Vec and DistilBERT models to identify the similarities of the text in lexical, semantic, and contextual levels that allowed the system to sort the inputs into four categories: cut-paste, light paraphrasing, heavy paraphrasing, and no match. To enhance precision, I came up with a hybrid similarity method, which combined the scores of cosine similarity, BERT-based embeddings, and word-overlap feature with an outcome of a robust classification accuracy of 90 percent. I developed an interactive interface with ipywidgets in Jupyter Notebook where people can enter text, see similarity measures and model predictions easily. The pipeline was also optimized to use CUDA acceleration to generate embedding faster and had extensive error handling of preprocessing, tokenization and model loading. With the help of this project, I improved my Python and NLP skills and provided a practical, efficient and user-friendly plagiarism detector tool applicable to academic and content-authentication plagiarism detection scenarios
